# Movies Data Project
I enjoy watching films, so I did a data analysis project about IMDb's Top 1000 movies.

## Background
Let's imagine that you are a data analyst for a film studio. The studio wants to make a film, but they are not sure what type of film they should make. They asked your team to analyze the IMBd Movies Dataset. The studio wants us to find patterns and trends in the dataset and present them to the stakeholders.
